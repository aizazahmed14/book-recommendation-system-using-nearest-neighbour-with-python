# AI-Powered Book Recommendation System

An efficient **AI-powered book recommendation system** built using **Python, TF-IDF, and Nearest Neighbors** to process millions of records without crashing! 🚀

## 🔥 Features
**✅ Scalable & Efficient:** Uses Nearest Neighbors (NN) instead of cosine similarity to handle large datasets
**✅ Fast Recommendations:** Recommends similar books based on title, author, and publisher
**✅ Memory Optimized:** Avoids system crashes using a limited feature TF-IDF approach
**✅ Easy to Use:** Simple Python function to get recommendations instantly
**✅ Customizable:** Can be extended with Flask API, Web App, or GUI


## 🛠 Tech Stack
1. Python 🐍
2. Pandas (Data handling)
3. Scikit-learn (Machine learning)
4. TF-IDF Vectorization (Text processing)
5. Nearest Neighbors (Efficient similarity search)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
**1. clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aizazahmed14/book-recommendation-system-using-nearest-neighbour-with-python.git
cd Book-Recommendation-System
```
**2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```
**3. Download the dataset and update the file path in the script.**

**4. Run the script:**
```bash
python book_recommendation.py

```

## 📝 How It Works?
1️Loads and cleans the dataset (Title, Author, Publisher)

2️Combines features into a single text representation

3️Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numbers

4️Applies Nearest Neighbors to find similar books

5️Returns the top 5 recommendations based on similarity
